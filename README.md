# Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression
## Overview
This project uses logistic regression to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on a set of health-related attributes. The dataset includes features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other indicators relevant to cardiovascular health.

## Project Structure
data/ - Folder containing the dataset.

notebooks/ - Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model development.

src/ - Source code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.

models/ - Saved trained models for reuse or further analysis.

README.md - Overview and instructions for the project (you are here!).

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/hhdjwdabsxsx/heart-disease-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction
2. Install required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Data Preprocessing - Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data for training.

python src/preprocess_data.py

Model Training - Train the logistic regression model on the preprocessed data.

python src/train_model.py

Evaluation - Evaluate the model on the test dataset to check its accuracy and other performance metrics.

python src/evaluate_model.py

## Future Work
Feature Engineering - Testing additional transformations and interactions between features.

Alternative Models - Comparing logistic regression with other algorithms, such as decision trees, random forests, or SVM.

Hyperparameter Tuning - Fine-tuning model parameters to improve accuracy.
